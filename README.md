# Pneumonia-Image-Classification-Web-App

This repository contains a Pneumonia Image Classifier Web App built using Python libraries. The web app is designed to assist in the diagnosis of pneumonia by analyzing chest X-ray images. It utilizes machine learning techniques to classify X-ray images into two categories: "Normal" and "Pneumonia."

## Features
User-Friendly Interface: The web app offers an intuitive user interface where users can easily upload their chest X-ray images for analysis.

Accurate Classification: The underlying image classifier employs a trained machine learning model to accurately classify X-ray images, aiding in the detection of pneumonia.

Instant Results: Once an image is uploaded, the app rapidly processes the image and provides real-time results, indicating whether pneumonia is present or not.

Educational Resource: Apart from its diagnostic utility, this project can serve as an educational resource to understand how image classification models can be integrated into web applications.

## Usage

Access the web app through a browser.

Click on the "Choose File" button to upload a chest X-ray image that needs analysis.

After uploading, click the "Submit" button to initiate the classification process.

The app will process the image and display the result, indicating whether the image shows signs of pneumonia or not.


## Model and Data
The image classification model used in this app is trained on a dataset of chest X-ray images. The model has been trained to recognize patterns associated with pneumonia. Please note that while the model is accurate, it is not a replacement for a professional medical diagnosis.

## Contribution

Contributions to the project are welcome! If you find any issues or want to enhance the app, feel free to create pull requests or open issues.
